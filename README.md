# PyShelveEditor
A Python Shelve Editor to edit the save-able data format "Shelve" 
USAGE: bro it's not that hard ðŸ’€

For adding keys, press on "Add a key" button, which will open up a new window.
Enter the new key-val pair and the respective types in that field, and click on the subsequent "Add the key" button, which will add that key to the main window's widget list. You'd see a new entry box series popping up in the bottom. You can then save the dict once you're done with it. 

To make sub-dictionary navigation easier, I've provided an "Edit Dict" button for values which're detected to be the python built-in dict datatype. That also has all the features like adding and removing a key. 

Removing a key, removes it from the widget list.

No operations would be saved unless you press on "Save Dict" in the MAIN window. 

Off topic: This was actually a utility that I wrote for my custom python shell "ParodyWindows11" or "PW11" (That's trash btw, but it's a hobby fun project), now dissociated from the custom shell's components.
